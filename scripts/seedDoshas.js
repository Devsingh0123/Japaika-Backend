Because the 7th house rules marriage and partnership, Mars creates intense heat, ego friction, impulsiveness, and sudden discord in relationships unless counterbalanced by classical cancellation rules.',
    effects: '1. Delays in finding a suitable spouse or sudden relationship disruptions.\n2. Temperamental clashes, high expectations, and domestic friction.\n3. Career or health fluctuations of the native or spouse during active Mars Dasha periods.\n4. Emotional distance if Mars is in the 12th house (bed pleasures and foreign settlement).',
